# Trailblazer Cart

This is the sample application for the RubyConf Au 2016 Trailblazer workshop.

The app is Open Source. https://github.com/apotonick/trb-cart

Creating Trailblazer and working on all the involved gems over the past 10 years has consumed an incredible amount of my time. I loved and still love every minute of it but a way to support that is [purchasing a copy of the book](https://leanpub.com/trailblazer).

Thanks so much!

## Setup
- modify `config/database.yml` to reflect your environment, then:
```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

## Running
This is a Ruby on Rails application. Start the server with `rails server`.

## Production

1. Compile assets: `rake assets:precompile`
2. Run server: `RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true RAILS_ENV=production rails s` (Thanks @fernandes!)
